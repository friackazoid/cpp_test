# Descriptio 

- `copy_vector_ctor.cpp` Is a C++ program designed to test how nested vectors are copied. The program examines the behavior of vector copy constructors to gain insight into how nested vectors behave during copying operations.

- `generate_functor.cpp` studies std::generator function behaviour with lambda, functor and templated functor with nested vector container 

- `op_with_templates.cpp` studies functor's behaviour
